# storm-streaming-topology

- demonstrates a simple storm topology that can be run from either on a local 
storm cluster (i.e. from eclipse or other development tool for dev/testing) or deployed to a storm cluster.

- provides a simple Spout and Bolt implementation.

- demonstrates a use case where the Spout reads messages from a JMS queue and after processing delivers the message to another JMS queue.
